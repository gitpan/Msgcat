Revision history for Perl extension Locale::Msgcat.

1.03 15 November 1999

	- Changed the name of the directory for the distribution, ie
	  Msgcat-version/ instead of Msgcat/.

1.02 15 November 1999

	- XPG4 says that the fields in the message catalog must be separated
	  by one blank, not many. Corrected this in the sample file.

1.01 12 November 1998
	- unlinks "sample.cat" after the test has been executed, as
	  "gencat" would otherwise update the catalog (XPG4).

1.00 26 July 1997
	- original version.
